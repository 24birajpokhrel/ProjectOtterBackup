/*
 * AccessiLens — styles/global.css
 *
 * Injected into EVERY webpage via manifest.json content_scripts.css.
 * Use this file for styles that must apply to the host page from OUTSIDE
 * a Shadow DOM — i.e., styles that content scripts need the host page to
 * inherit or that cannot be scoped to a Shadow root.
 *
 * CURRENT STATUS: Intentionally empty.
 *   - Focus Ruler styles live in ruler-shadow.css (injected into Shadow DOM)
 *   - Visual Filters styles are injected programmatically by visual-filters.js
 *   - Typography styles will be injected programmatically by typography-engine.js
 *
 * WHEN TO ADD RULES HERE:
 *   - Font-face declarations (e.g. OpenDyslexic for typography-engine)
 *   - Global CSS custom property overrides on :root
 *   - Any reset rules that features depend on being present before they run
 *
 * DO NOT ADD:
 *   - Opinionated layout or visual styles that affect normal page rendering
 *   - Rules that would conflict with host page styles without !important guards
 *   - Large amounts of CSS — keep this file minimal and purposeful
